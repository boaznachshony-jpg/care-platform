# CareDesk Agent Coordination Dashboard

This dashboard is the shared coordination state for concurrent engineering agents. Update it in the same PR whenever ownership, dependencies, blockers, or next action change.

## Coordination rules

- Authority: `origin/main` + GitHub Issues + PRs + this dashboard.
- Before work/resume/push: fetch and synchronize with the latest `origin/main`.
- One active task has one owning agent unless an explicit split is recorded here.
- Dependent implementation waits for prerequisite merge unless `Parallel safe` is explicitly `yes`.
- A blocked agent records the blocker here instead of silently waiting.

## Active work

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Workstream | Issue | Owner/Agent | Branch | PR | Status | Depends on | Parallel safe | Blocker | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current delivery coordination | — | Orchestrator | `main` | — | ACTIVE | — | n/a | None recorded | Assign each new task through an Issue and update this row set before parallel implementation |

## Required status values

Use exactly one of: `PLANNED`, `ACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `IN_REVIEW`, `MERGED_VERIFYING`, `DONE`, `CANCELLED`.

## Update contract

For every active engineering task, add one row containing:

- Workstream: short human-readable scope
- Issue: `#123`
- Owner/Agent: unique agent/task label
- Branch: exact branch name
- PR: `#123` or `—` before creation
- Status: one allowed value
- Depends on: prerequisite Issue/PR or `—`
- Parallel safe: `yes`, `no`, or `n/a`
- Blocker: exact blocker or `None`
- Next action: one concrete next step

When a task reaches `DONE`, retain the row until the next coordination closeout so downstream agents can see the completed dependency history.

## Handoff record

Every agent handoff must include: Issue, branch, PR, latest commit, completed scope, validation evidence, blockers, dependencies, and next action.

## Freshness rule

If this dashboard conflicts with merged code or GitHub state, `origin/main` and GitHub are authoritative. The orchestrator must correct this file immediately; agents must not proceed using a known-stale dashboard.
